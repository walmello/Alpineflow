# Alpineflow
Alpine JS plugins for Webflow Users

You will need to add Alpine.js to make it work
<script src="//unpkg.com/alpinejs" defer></script>

and add a CDN like this one to your webflow project:
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/walmello24/alpineflow@master/main.js"></script>

## What is this repository?
This is a collection of helpers, plugins, directives to help in the integration of Alpine with Webflow.
It can work with other builders that are not Webflow. but they where made with Webflow in mind
